To design a platform that I can use to write and deploy Automated Trading Robots with visual tracking components.

Bar Charts
    Bar styles and colors
    Supports renko
Open Trades
    Including Stop Losses
    History Analytics? or integration with that forex balance tracker
Capability to run trading bot scripts
    Potentially using an embedded language such as lua or python
    Backtesting with simulated spread


How to start?

We need a window, and a way to display custom graphics of some sort, I should'nt need OpenGL or anything like that
Draw historical data
Open and close trades
